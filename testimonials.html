                <p>Have known Austin for a number of years and unprompted, wanted to write a short note of recommendation. He works diligently and is modest in his approach which sometimes belies the depth of his experience and knowledge – he possesses and
                    asserts an understanding of financial controls and compliance that underscores his professionalism in this area. Whilst pragmatic in nature he clearly and reassuringly guides on what is acceptable or otherwise – a valuable and essential
                    member of any team having significant financial accountability.
                    <br> Apart from that a very likeable and engaging person.</p>

                <p>Austin was involved in delivering Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance services to Ericsson in Region sub-Saharan Africa. He was highly professional and very supportive of all staff. It was a challenging assignment, but he delivered and met
                    all his commitments, on time, every time.</p>

                <p>Mr, Nyika was involved in the implementation of the Access Dimensions ERP system at Kilimanjaro Airports Development Company in Tanzania. The system promised improvements in the operations of our Accounting and Finance department, including
                    providing an efficient way of tracking and managing our Fixed Assets. Apart from the setup of the new system, the tasks behind the project included migration of data from our existing system into the new system, design of reports and
                    documents, and training of users in the effective usage of the system. I am glad to say that through Mr. Nyika's dedication and professionalism, our organization was able to realize the promised returns from this investment, in terms
                    of tangible improvements in our operations. I am glad to recommend him.
